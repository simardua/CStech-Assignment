## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd agent-management-system
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/agent-management
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Database Setup

Start MongoDB service on your system, then create an admin user:

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongo

# Switch to the agent-management database
use agent-management

# Create an admin user (replace with your desired credentials)
db.users.insertOne({
  email: "admin@example.com",
  password: "$2a$10$8K1p/a0drtIzq.z2W0sEUeXvuXkGGrMpvV1o2f3QzjEzX4YgHv6g2", // password: "admin123"
  role: "admin",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
})
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Production Mode

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Serve the build directory with your preferred web server
```

## Usage

### 1. Login
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Use the admin credentials you created in the database
- Default credentials (if you used the example):
  - Email: admin@example.com
  - Password: admin123

### 2. Add Agents
- Navigate to the "Agents" tab
- Fill in the agent form with:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Mobile number (with country code)
  - Password
- Click "Create Agent"

### 3. Upload and Distribute Lists
- Navigate to the "Upload Lists" tab
- Select a CSV, XLSX, or XLS file with columns:
  - FirstName (or firstName, First Name)
  - Phone (or phone, Phone Number)
  - Notes (or notes, Note)
- Click "Upload and Distribute"
- View the distribution summary

### 4. View Distributions
- Navigate to the "View Distributions" tab
- Click on any distribution to see detailed records
- View how records were distributed among agents

## File Format Requirements

### Supported File Types
- CSV (.csv)
- Excel (.xlsx, .xls)

### Required Columns
Your file must contain these columns (case-insensitive):
- **FirstName** (or firstName, First Name)
- **Phone** (or phone, Phone Number)
- **Notes** (or notes, Note)

### Example CSV Format
```csv
FirstName,Phone,Notes
John Doe,+1234567890,Follow up next week
Jane Smith,+0987654321,Interested in product A
Bob Johnson,+1122334455,Schedule demo call
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Admin login

### Agents
- `GET /api/agents` - Get all agents
- `POST /api/agents` - Create new agent
- `PUT /api/agents/:id` - Update agent
- `DELETE /api/agents/:id` - Delete agent

### Lists
- `POST /api/lists/upload` - Upload and distribute file
- `GET /api/lists` - Get all distributions
- `GET /api/lists/:id` - Get distribution details

## Distribution Logic

The system distributes records using the following algorithm:

1. **Equal Distribution**: Records are divided equally among all active agents
2. **Remainder Handling**: If total records aren't divisible by agent count, remaining records are distributed sequentially
3. **Example**: 
   - 25 records √∑ 5 agents = 5 records each
   - 27 records √∑ 5 agents = 5 records each + 2 extra records to first 2 agents

## Error Handling

### File Upload Validation
- File type validation (CSV, XLSX, XLS only)
- File size limit (10MB maximum)
- Content validation (required columns check)
- Empty file detection

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation
- Protected route enforcement
- Session management

### Database Operations
- Connection error handling
- Validation error responses
- Duplicate entry prevention

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. MongoDB Connection Error**
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
```
Solution: Ensure MongoDB service is running

**2. Port Already in Use**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5000
```
Solution: Change the PORT in .env file or stop the process using the port

**3. File Upload Issues**
- Ensure file has correct format and required columns
- Check file size (must be under 10MB)
- Verify file permissions

**4. Login Issues**
- Verify admin user exists in database
- Check password encryption (use bcrypt)
- Ensure JWT_SECRET is set in .env

## Security Features

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Protected API routes
- File type validation
- SQL injection prevention (using Mongoose)
- Input validation and sanitization

## Performance Considerations

- File processing is done in memory for optimal performance
- Pagination can be added for large agent lists
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- File cleanup after processing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the system:

1. **Role-based Access Control**
   - Different permission levels
   - Agent login functionality

2. **Advanced Distribution Options**
   - Custom distribution algorithms
   - Territory-based assignments
   - Skills-based matching

3. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Distribution performance metrics
   - Agent workload analytics
   - File processing statistics

4. **Email Integration**
   - Automatic notifications to agents
   - Distribution summary emails
   - File processing confirmations

5. **Real-time Features**
   - WebSocket integration
   - Live distribution updates
   - Real-time notifications
